      <p id="welcome_text"> Recently, at the Massachusetts Institue of Technology (MIT) an ultra useful new way on
        gaining power has been discovered! They are <b> Paper-thin solar cells </b> and may just be the future of
        sustainable energy.</b> </p>

      <p id="adver_welcome_text"> Why, you might ask? Its simple: These photovoltaic cells are very slim, suprisingly
        durable and practical. They can in theory withstand weather and can be attached to almost any surface - and turn
        them into an energy source! Its not just that though - in power-per-kilogram, they even surpass regular solar
        panals at creating energy. This can be especially useful when... </p>

        <li class="Candoele">...you don't have batteries with you and want to power other devices like a radio...</li>
        <li class="Candoele">...or you just want to live sustainably at home and create your own electricity, without
          the worry of huge solar panels on your roof!</li>

        it possible for them to be mass produced with affordable costs!</p>

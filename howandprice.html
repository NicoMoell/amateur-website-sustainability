            <p> Few of the endless possibilities of the usage of the cells I already presented on the home page. But
                there are many more ways to implement the solar
                cells into daily life. And the best thing is, that we can use it as a private person too! So what
                actually can you do with it? For that, here is a list with all the possiblities: </p>

            <p> The most important benefits and usages at one glance:</p>

            <img src="Pictures/Overviewbenefits.png" alt="Overview benefts" id="overviewbenefitspic">

            <p>Just imagine the possibilities. They could be integrated onto the sails of a boat to provide power while
                at sea, put onto tents and tarps that are deployed in disaster recovery operations, or applied onto the
                wings of drones to extend their flying range.</p>

            <h2 class="usefinally"> So, what does it cost and when can I finally use it?</h2>
            <p> Sadly there is no answer as of yet to either of these questions. Since the discovery is new and, as I
                said
                already, they still need to find and make a ultra thin and lightweight weather proof material for the
                cells
                and add it to the cells, there aren't any anwswers. </p>
            <p>
                What I do know however is that they know what makes a new solar cell popular on the market: efficiency
                and
                cost in dollars-per-watt. But now with the extreamly-thin solar cells. There is a unique element to
                these
                cells - the ease of the installation and the portability. It also helps that the efficiency is better
                than
                regular solar cells and the manufacturing process is now cheaper than ever bevor. The cost of the
                weather
                proof material is still missing, however.

        <div>
            <h2 class="usefinally"> Conclusion and the future</h2>
            <p> So in conclusion, we have: </p>
            <ul class="checkmark">
                <li>Cheaper Production</li>
                <li>Increased and better efficiency</li>
                <li>Unique portability</li>
                <li>Cheap materials used in the process</li>
            </ul>
            <p> This sets the paper-thin solar cells up to be a revolutionary technology on the market and in a few
                years, when everything is figured out, the industry will soon mass produce them for everyone - industry
                and private person alike. <br> So be ready, because when it hits, we can be ready for a future with
                increased solar cells - one we couldn't have withput this technology! </p>

            <p> As already said, these photovoltaic cells are really thin. So thin in fact, that they are less that 0.1
                milimeters thick and weigh 0.1 kilograms per square meter. But how is that achieved? With a special
                production method. </p>

            <h2 id="production_title"> The production</h2>
            <p class="mar"> The paper thin solar cells are actually not a new technology. Six years ago, the ONE Lab
                produced simular cells. They were also thin, but the materials themselves were more expensive and the
                process to create them was very complex and expensive. This changes now.</p>
            <p class="mar"> The production process and materials now are first of all much cheaper and second of all
                much better to execute and scale up. They now developed solar cells that are completely printable and
                ink-based materials. Here is how they did it:</p>

            <div>
                <ol class="steps">
                    <li><span>Firstly they coated a sheet of plastic with a few micrometers thick layer of parylene, an
                            electrically insulating material that offers protection against moisture and chemical
                            corrosion.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Then they used printable inks made of different materials to deposit various layers of
                            solar-cell components onto the parylene-coated plastic sheet.</span></li>
                    <li><span>The MIT team then selected an organic semiconductor for the active light-to-electricity
                            conversion layer. Transparent electrodes were made using silver nanowires and a conductive
                            polymer. Perovskites were considered for higher efficiency, acknowledging their
                            vulnerability to moisture and oxygen degradation.</span></li>
                    <li><span>After that they applied a few micrometers of glue around the edges of the solar
                            cells.</span></li>
                    <li><span>In the final steps, the team fixed the solar cells to a performance fabric that is both
                            strong and lightweight.</span></li>
                    <li><span>The last step is to carefully peel off the fabric, transferring the very thin parylene
                            substrate and the solar stack on top of it. This action effectively transfers the solar
                            modules onto the fabric.</span></li>
                </ol>

            <p id="textvid"> Here is a visualisation of it so you can understand it better:</p>

            <p> One lightweight fabric they found worked perfectly is the <b>Dyneema</b> a composite fabric that weighs
                only 13 grams per square meter. It makes the solar cells more durable, while still keeping it
                lightweight and flexible. It is commonly used for offshore activities like in cables and nets when
                fishing or when climbing, since it's also used in climbing equipment. </p>

            </div>

            <div>
                <p> To not interfere with the efficiency of the solar cells, they don't print the solar cells directly
                    on the fabric, but instead use a UV-curable glue, to stick the solar modules to sheets of the
                    fabric. </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;"> The efficiency outshines normal solar cells</h2>
                <p>During the testing, the MIT researchers found that the device could produce 730 watts of power per
                    kilogram when not attached to anything. When it was placed on the strong Dyneema fabric, it still
                    managed to generate about 370 watts per kilogram. This is a significant improvement compared to
                    regular solar cells, which only generate a fraction of that power per kilogram. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    And if we for example say that the average typical solar installation on a rooftop generates about
                    8.000 watts, the superthin cells would only at 20 kilograms to the roof, instead of the roughly 300
                    kilograms normal solar cells would add!

                    id="picsolarinstall">
                <p> Here is the impressive differance between normal cells and the extra thin ones:</p>

            <div>
                <p>They also tested the durability of their devices and found that, even after rolling and unrolling a
                    fabric solar panel more than 500 times, the cells still retained more than 90 percent of their
                    initial power generation capabilities.</p>
                <h2 id="marketwhy"> Why isn't it on the market then?</h2>
                <p> Well, firstly because this new technology was only discovered it in winter last year. But it's also
                    not on the market or in mass production because they still need something to protect them from wind
                    and weather. </p>
                <p> “Encasing these solar cells in heavy glass, as is standard with the traditional silicon solar cells,
                    would minimize the value of the present advancement, so the team is currently developing ultrathin
                    packaging solutions that would only fractionally increase the weight of the present ultralight
                    devices,” says Mwaura, a research scientist in the MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics.</p>
